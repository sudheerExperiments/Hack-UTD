# Electricity Usage forecasting

## Dataset 

https://openei.org/datasets/dataset/commercial-and-residential-hourly-load-profiles-for-all-tmy3-locations-in-the-united-states

I used only part 1 and part 2 due to space constraints and limited computing power.

The dataset is divided into multiple folders, each folder has electricity usage readings taken per hour for a duration of a month.
